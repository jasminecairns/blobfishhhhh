            <h1 style="text-align: center; color: darkred;">A shrine? About a LEGO cartoon?!</h1>
            <p>
              Yes, really. I mean it when I say it‚Äôs peak!!!
            </p>
            <p>
              I did not expect to fall in love Lego Monkie Kid, but the animation, the characters and how they grow, the mix of Chinese, Western, and even a bit of Japanese culture‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ they all hooked me in! 
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: darkred;">So‚Ä¶ what is Lego Monkie Kid?</h2>
           <p>Lego Monkie Kid is an animated TV series inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West" target="_blank">Journey to the West</a>, centering around a young man named MK, the successor to the Legendary Monkey King.  He and his friends Pigsy, Mr. Tang, Mei, Sandy, and sometimes Monkey King himself, go on great adventures, as our hero learns to grow both as a fighter and a person.</p>
           <p>The pilot, Lego Monkie Kid: A Legend is Born aixqred in China on May 29, 2020, as well as Malaysia on June 13th, 2020.  The series itself began airing in Malaysia on September 13th, 2020, and in the United States on September 9th, 2021 on Amazon Kids+.</p>
           <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Monkie_Kid" target="_blank">yes i got my info from wikipedia how could u tell....</a></small>
          <h2 style="color: darkred;">Why I love it so much </h2>
          <p>The first thing that drew me into the show was the animation.  The characters in Monkie Kid may move differently from what you would expect from other Lego movies and shows, like Ninjago or the Lego Movie.  Thanks to the power of 2D animation, everyone in the show is free to squash and and stretch however the artists see fit. I absolutely love how expressive the characters are!</p>
          <p>Also, the writing gets better with each season*!  In the first season, the characters and story are simple but charming.  But as the show progress, more depth and little details are added to the characters, and each arc becomes more intense!  I adored seeing the characters grow and overcome new challenges (rewrite).  Also, the character designs are so sick too! Who knew Legos could look so cool???</p>
          <p>The aspect of Lego Monkie Kid that resonates with me the most is the culture behind it.  In the Lego documentary,<i>A LEGO Journey to the East</i>, designers traveled to China to study its culture, especially The Journey to the West and Monkey King (would recommend checking it if you can btw).  The writing team consistently checked with Chinese Lego employees to ensure that not only the story and dialogue are appropriate in the context of Chinese culture, but also that   their culture oozed through the theme and show's art.  You can tell from the character designs, backgrounds, music, and references to Journey to the West. I really love how a Lego show can portray Asian culture in a way that's so cool and modern, while also acknowledging and respecting their roots. Literally so peak and kinda inspiring. <strong>Also I loved the Lunar New Year special so much !!!! It reminds me of when I've celebrated it too ^^</strong></p>
          <p>Oh yea the backgrounds are super pretty! Love their use of color and how they can easily switch from modern and ancient settings!</p>
          <p><small>*season 5 kind fell off mostly but shhhhhh</small></p>

          <div class="section" id="s2" style="display: none;">
            <h1 style="text-align: center; color: darkgreen;">Thoughts throughout each season</h1>
            <p>(most of this is bullet points for now. i'll get around to writing them in full later on)</p>
            <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Season 1</h2>
            <p>Season 1 is a great start for Monkie Kid. Although I won't lie, the pilot and season final carried a lot of the weight in this! From how I felt watching it, the pilot throws a lot of things at you that I can still get all giddy about.  The way it presents both ancient and modern Chinese culture, the lovely animation and visuals, the action, the sudden mech transformation?!, and the parallel to how Monkey King and MK both defeated Demon Bull King in the same way????? It's sooooo good. The rest of the season is simple but charming, introducing recurring characters while also showing adventures that lean a bit more silly / teaching morals than action. The finale does a great job providing an exciting closing, while also foreshadowing at Spider Queen's rise.  Overall it's a pretty simple but charming season üëç</p>
            <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Season 2</h2>

              </ul>
          </p>
           <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Season 3</h2>
           <p>
            <ul>
              <li>even peaker than before</li>
              <li>generally just more exciting to me, especially bc of more action and new characters / settings this time</li>

              <li>theme of legacy / fate is cool</li>
