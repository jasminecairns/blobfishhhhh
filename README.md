My Neocites site

### Various resources I used (not including those in other directories):

(the layout builder was very useful and quite a bit of code was stolen from it lol)

### things i wanna add
~~- blog !!!!!!!!~~ it's empty but it's there
- make layout prettier :3c
- shrines?
- something unique

### saving for end
- working links in professional info
- guestbook
- hit counter
- refine index text

### know issues:
- loading issue
    - when going to a different page, it reloads the whole page, which causes uncomfortable flashing if refreshed / loaded rapidly
    - loading is generally a little slow, but this is more forgivable due to this site being graphics heavy (and i won't change that :3)
- scm music player issues (removed player for now)
    - messes with routing somehow (loads content for different page despite not changing url)
    - accessibility issues (play, skip, player, etc. are not labeled)
    - loading issues (takes a long time to load)
- youtube embed issues
    - causes multiple "unreachable code after return statement", likely a firefox issue
