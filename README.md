My Neocites site, inspired by the chaotic yet simpler approach of old web sites.  Mainly serves as a place to share my projects outside of school / work.

If I'm missing credit for literally anything on this site, please let me know!

All opnions are my own and are not endorsed by my school or employers.

### Various resources I used (not including those in other directories):

(the layout builder was very useful and quite a bit of code was stolen from it lol)

### known issues:
- loading issue
    - maruqee in header doesn't move untill a couple seconds after page loaded
    - when going to a different page, it reloads the whole page, which causes uncomfortable flashing if refreshed / loaded rapidly
        - lazily fixed with background colors that are similar to the background images     
        - attempted to resolve this by linking to html files instead of links, but this doesnt work. at least allows me to run this site locally
    - loading is generally a little slow, but this is more forgivable due to this site being graphics heavy (and i want it to be graphics heaby :3)
- scm music player issues (removed player for now, replaced with youtube embed)
    - messes with routing somehow (loads content for different page despite not changing url)
    - accessibility issues (play, skip, player, etc. are not labeled)
    - loading issues (takes a long time to load)
- youtube embed issues
    - causes multiple "unreachable code after return statement", likely a firefox issue
